# Python crash course projects

### Alien Invasion: Making a Game with Python
In the Alien Invasion project (Chapters 12, 13, and 14), you’ll use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. At the end of the project, you’ll have learned skills that will enable you to develop your own 2D games in Pygame.

### Data Visualization
The Data Visualization project starts in Chapter 15, in which you’ll learn to generate data and create a series of functional and beautiful visualizations of that data using matplotlib and Pygal. Chapter 16 teaches you to access data from online sources and feed it into a visualization package to create plots of weather data and a world population map. Finally, Chapter 17 shows you how to write a program to automatically download and visualize data. Learning to make visualizations allows you to explore the field of data mining, which is a highly sought-after skill in the world today.

### Web applications
In the Web Applications project (Chapters 18, 19, and 20), you’ll use the Django package to create a simple web application that allows users to keep a journal about any number of topics they’ve been learning about. Users will create an account with a username and password, enter a topic, and then make entries about what they’re learning. You’ll also learn how to deploy your app so anyone in the world can access it.  
After completing this project, you’ll be able to start building your own simple web applications, and you’ll be ready to delve into more thorough resources on building applications with Django.
